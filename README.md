How to run program.

I attached a makefile to the project.
First do "make build" (without quotations)
Next do "make run" and then it will run the program with arguments already given.

If you want to add your own arguments
You can just type "javac Main.java" (without quotations)
And then java Main (points here) (transaction.csv here)
