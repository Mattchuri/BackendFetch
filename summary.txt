1.) For this project, I used the java.time package to really help parse and order the dates (In Offset encoding)
    I also decided to make my CSV parser not use ".split()" because I wanted to make sure that commas inside quotes
    were accounted for. Moreover, I used a hashMap for constant time searches.
    Overall, I used java because it is a comfortable language for me to use object-oriented programming.

2.) As mentioned before, the advantages of my CSV parsing solution is that it can take into account when commas are written in quotes (which
    often time they are in titles). I also think my code scales well with the use of HashMaps and excluding nested for loops. I'd say some of the
    disadvantages with using java , specifically, is that the code can get messy fast with too many objects. Naming the variables and methods were
    important. I'd also say that my java program doesn't run as fast as programs written in C++ / Python.

3.) My favorite school project so far was implementing Djikstra's algorithm. Up until then, we had only mainly implemented data structures whilst
    briefly looking at some sorting algorithms. I thoroughly enjoyed graphs and graph algorithms because I like their analogies to connections and
    links (cellphone towers, maps, literally everything navegationally important). It was really challenging because I didn't know how to implement
    the helper data structure needed for Djikstra's. But once I got it done, it was the best feeling ever and I even got a 40/40 on it!
